## Features

- Use various test commands to confirm bot is working.


## Tech

- [Discord API] - necessary for creating a Discord bot
- [CoinMarketCap API] - API responsible for cryptocurrency information
- [Visual Studio Code] - code editor used in creation of the bot's code. 


## Installation

This Discord bot requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.9+ to run. Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.

To install the Discord API, the instructions within the [Rapptz/discord.py Github](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 'README' file was used. 

For a quick installation on a Windows 10 device, open the Windows 10 'Command Prompt' and enter the following into the terminal:
```sh
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

The bot's code uses a `.gitignore` file to hide files containing unnecessary or sensitive information. To create and format the `.gitignore` file:
1. Inside the directory that's also storing the `.git` folder, `src` folder, and `README.md` file, create a new, blank text file and name it `.gitignore`.
2. Access the `.gitignore` file using the default Windows 10 application 'Notepad', or any other text editor application.
3. In the `.gitignore` file, type the directory path for each unnecessary or information-sensitive file. Make certain to type each file's directory path on a separate line. For example:
```sh
1   src/hidden
2   src/cogs/__psycache__
```

For the example above, `src/hidden` is a folder named `hidden` that is being stored in the `src` directory. For this source code, all files being hidden by `.gitignore` were stored in `src/hidden`, as long as they were able to be stored in `src/hidden`. The `secrets.json` file stored within the `hidden` folder is holding information for the API keys, used for both the Discord API and the CoinMarketCap API. Below shows the format used for the source `secrets.json` file.
```sh
1   {
2       "keys": {
3           "discord": "EXAMPLE_KEY",
4           "coinmarketcap": "EXAMPLE_KEY"
5       }
6   }
```
> Note: the keys for Discord and CoinMarketCap -- seen as `EXAMPLE_KEY` in the example above -- would be replaced with API keys generated by the individual intending to use this Discord bot.

To change the command prefix, change the text in between the single quotations of the code below (found on `line 11` of the `bot.py` file).
```sh
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '.')
```
If the command prefix needed to be `!`, the code below is an example of what the code would look like.
```sh
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!')
```
> If the `bot.py` file uses the above example line of code, commands will only be able to get called using `!` as the prefix. For example, the `test` command would be called by a user by typing `!test`.
