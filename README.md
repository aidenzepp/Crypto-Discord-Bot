#

## Tech

- [Discord API] - necessary for creating a Discord bot
- [CoinMarketCap API] - API responsible for cryptocurrency information
- [Visual Studio Code] - code editor used in creation of the bot's code. 

#

## Installation

This Discord bot requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.9+ to run. Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.

To install the Discord API, the instructions within the [Rapptz/discord.py Github](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 'README' file was used. 

For a quick installation on a Windows 10 device, open the Windows 10 'Command Prompt' and enter the following into the terminal:
```sh
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

--

In order to retrieve data and push out information via **CoinMarketCap**, the [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) Python library must be installed.

For a quick installation on a Windows 10 device, open the Windows 10 'Command Prompt' and enter the following into the terminal:
```sh
python -m pip install requests
```
> **Note:** the author of this code encountered an 'module not found' error (using 'Visual Studio Code'); the solution was to change the Python PATH used, found in the bottom left of VSCode.

The bot's code uses a `.gitignore` file to hide files containing unnecessary or sensitive information. To create and format the `.gitignore` file:
1. Inside the directory that's also storing the `.git` folder, `src` folder, and `README.md` file, create a new, blank text file and name it `.gitignore`.
2. Access the `.gitignore` file using the default Windows 10 application 'Notepad', or any other text editor application.
3. In the `.gitignore` file, type the directory path for each unnecessary or information-sensitive file. Make certain to type each file's directory path on a separate line. For example:
```sh
1   src/hidden
2   src/cogs/__psycache__
```

For the example above, `src/hidden` is a folder named `hidden` that is being stored in the `src` directory. For this source code, all files being hidden by `.gitignore` were stored in `src/hidden`, as long as they were able to be stored in `src/hidden`. The `secrets.json` file stored within the `hidden` folder is holding information for the API keys, used for both the Discord API and the CoinMarketCap API. Below shows the format used for the source `secrets.json` file.
```sh
1   {
2       "keys": {
3           "discord": "EXAMPLE_KEY",
4           "coinmarketcap": "EXAMPLE_KEY"
5       }
6   }
```
> Note: the keys for Discord and CoinMarketCap -- seen as `EXAMPLE_KEY` in the example above -- would be replaced with API keys generated by the individual intending to use this Discord bot.

## FAQ

##### ***Q: How do I change the command prefix?***

To change the command prefix, change the text in between the single quotations of the code below (found on `line 11` of the `bot.py` file).
```sh
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '.')
```

If the command prefix needed to be `!`, the code below is an example of what the code would look like.
```sh
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!')
```
> If the `bot.py` file uses the above example line of code, commands will only be able to get called using `!` as the prefix. For example, the `test` command would be called by a user by typing `!test`.
